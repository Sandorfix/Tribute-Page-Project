            Louis Armstrong (August 4, 1901–July 6, 1971) was a masterful trumpet player and beloved entertainer in the
            20th century. He rose above the hardship and challenges of poverty from a young age and the racism he was
            subjected to throughout his life to become one of the most influential musicians of his genre.

            <br>
            He played a key role in the development of one of the early 20th century's most important new styles of
            music: jazz. Though he mostly kept quiet about racial discrimination, much to the disapproval of fellow
            Black Americans, Armstrong sparked controversy when he spoke out publicly against segregation in Little
            Rock, Arkansas, in 1957.

            <br>
            Armstrong's inventiveness and improvisational techniques—along with his energetic, dazzling style—have
            influenced generations of musicians. One of the first to perform scat-style singing, he is also well-known
            for his distinctive, gravelly singing voice. Armstrong wrote two autobiographies, becoming the first Black
            jazz musician to write an autobiography, and appeared in more than 30 films.
